		In the ever-evolving world of cloud computing, two key service models—Software as a Service (SaaS) and Platform
		as a Service (PaaS)—are at the forefront of enabling businesses to leverage the cloud for greater flexibility,
		scalability, and cost-efficiency. While both are part of the broader Cloud Computing ecosystem, they serve
		different purposes and cater to different needs. This guide aims to clarify what SaaS and PaaS are, how they
		differ, and how organizations can benefit from each model.
	</p>

	<h2 style="color: #1e2a3a">What is Software as a Service (SaaS)?</h2>
	<p style="font-size: 16px; color: #555; line-height: 1.6">
		Software as a Service (SaaS) refers to software applications that are hosted and managed by a third-party
		provider, accessible via the internet, and typically offered on a subscription basis. With SaaS, users don’t
		need to worry about installation, maintenance, or infrastructure management; everything is handled by the
		service provider.
	</p>

	<h3 style="color: #1e2a3a">Key Features of SaaS:</h3>
	<ul style="font-size: 16px; color: #555; list-style-type: disc; padding-left: 20px">
		<li>
			<strong>Cloud-Based Access:</strong> SaaS applications are hosted on the cloud, meaning users can access
			them from anywhere with an internet connection.
		</li>
		<li>

	</ul>

	<h2 style="color: #1e2a3a">What is Platform as a Service (PaaS)?</h2>
	<p style="font-size: 16px; color: #555; line-height: 1.6">
		Platform as a Service (PaaS) is a cloud computing model that provides a platform for developers to build,
		deploy, and manage applications without having to worry about the underlying infrastructure (servers, storage,
		networking). PaaS provides a set of tools, libraries, and services that developers can use to create
		applications more efficiently.
	</p>

	<h3 style="color: #1e2a3a">Key Features of PaaS:</h3>
	<ul style="font-size: 16px; color: #555; list-style-type: disc; padding-left: 20px">
		<li>
			<strong>Development Framework:</strong> PaaS platforms provide development tools, frameworks, and libraries
			that make it easier to build and deploy applications.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Managed Infrastructure:</strong> Unlike SaaS, PaaS doesn’t offer a ready-made software application.
			Instead, it provides the underlying infrastructure, so developers can focus on creating applications without
			managing hardware.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Scalability:</strong> Like SaaS, PaaS solutions are scalable, allowing applications to grow in
			response to increasing demand.
		</li>
		<li>
