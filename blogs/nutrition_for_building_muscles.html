		<p>
			Building muscle requires not just hard work in the gym, but also proper nutrition. Your body needs the right
			nutrients to repair muscle tissue, improve strength, and grow effectively. Whether you're new to lifting or
			an experienced gym-goer, understanding the importance of diet in muscle building is crucial.

		<h2 class="section-title">1. Prioritize Protein</h2>
		<p>
			Protein is the building block of muscle tissue, and consuming enough of it is key to muscle growth. Aim for
			around 1.6 to 2.2 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight per day. This will help in muscle repair and
			growth after training.
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Chicken breast, turkey, and lean beef are great sources of animal protein.</li>
			<li>For vegetarians, try plant-based proteins like lentils, chickpeas, quinoa, and tofu.</li>
			<li>Whey protein is a convenient option for quick post-workout nutrition.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2 class="section-title">2. Carbohydrates for Energy</h2>
		<p>
			Carbohydrates are the body’s primary source of energy, especially for intense workouts. Without sufficient
			carbs, your muscles may not have enough fuel to perform at their best. Include complex carbohydrates like
			whole grains, oats, and sweet potatoes in your diet.
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Whole wheat pasta, brown rice, and quinoa are excellent carb sources.</li>
			<li>Fruits like bananas provide quick-digesting carbs that are perfect for pre-workout meals.</li>
			<li>Avoid processed carbs, which can lead to blood sugar spikes and crashes.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2 class="section-title">3. Healthy Fats</h2>
		<p>
			Fat plays a vital role in hormone production, including testosterone, which is important for muscle growth.
			Healthy fats are also essential for absorbing fat-soluble vitamins like vitamins A, D, E, and K.
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Avocados, nuts, seeds, and olive oil are excellent sources of healthy fats.</li>
			<li>
				Fish like salmon provides omega-3 fatty acids, which can help reduce inflammation and promote muscle
				recovery.
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h2 class="section-title">4. Stay Hydrated</h2>
		<p>
			Proper hydration is often overlooked but is critical for muscle function and recovery. Muscles are made up
			of about 75% water, so staying hydrated ensures that you have enough fluid for optimal performance and
			recovery.
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Drink at least 8 cups (2 liters) of water per day, and more if you’re training intensely.</li>
			<li>Consider adding electrolyte drinks if you're sweating a lot during workouts.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2 class="section-title">5. Timing Your Meals</h2>
		<p>
			When you eat is just as important as what you eat. Proper meal timing ensures that your body is fueled
			properly before, during, and after workouts.
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Eat a balanced meal 2-3 hours before your workout with carbs, protein, and fats.</li>
			<li>After your workout, consume a protein-rich meal within 30-60 minutes to aid muscle recovery.</li>
			<li>Aim for 4-6 smaller meals throughout the day to maintain a steady supply of nutrients.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2 class="section-title">6. Supplement Wisely</h2>
		<p>
			While whole foods should be your primary source of nutrition, certain supplements can help you reach your
			muscle-building goals. The most effective and scientifically supported supplements include:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Whey protein: for post-workout recovery.</li>
			<li>Creatine: to improve strength and power.</li>
			<li>Branched-Chain Amino Acids (BCAAs): for reducing muscle soreness.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2 class="section-title">Conclusion</h2>
		<p>
			Building muscle is a combination of proper training and effective nutrition. By focusing on protein, carbs,
			healthy fats, staying hydrated, and timing your meals, you can maximize muscle growth and recovery.
			Remember, supplements can support your progress, but whole foods should always be your foundation.
