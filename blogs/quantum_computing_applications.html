<h2>1. Understanding Quantum Computing</h2>
<p>
	Quantum computing is based on the principles of quantum mechanics, a fundamental branch of physics that describes
	nature at the smallest scales. Unlike classical computers that use bits to process information as 0s and 1s, quantum
	computers use quantum bits or qubits, which can exist in multiple states simultaneously.
</p>

<h3>1.1 Qubits and Superposition</h3>
<p>
	Qubits are the fundamental units of quantum information. Unlike classical bits that are binary, qubits can exist in
	a superposition of states, meaning they can represent both 0 and 1 simultaneously. This property enables quantum
	computers to perform many calculations at once.
</p>

<h3>1.2 Entanglement</h3>
<p>
	Entanglement is a phenomenon where two or more qubits become interconnected, such that the state of one qubit
	directly affects the state of the other, no matter the distance between them. This unique feature allows for faster
	data processing and complex problem-solving.
</p>

<h3>1.3 Quantum Gates</h3>
<p>
	Quantum gates manipulate qubits using quantum mechanics principles. These gates are analogous to classical logic
	gates but operate in a multidimensional state space, allowing for complex computational tasks.
