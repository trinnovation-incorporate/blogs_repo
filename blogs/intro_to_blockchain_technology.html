	</p>

	<h2 style="color: #34495e; font-size: 2em; margin-bottom: 10px">Understanding Blockchain Technology</h2>
	<h3 style="color: #2980b9; font-size: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 10px">What is Blockchain Technology?</h3>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 20px">
		A blockchain is a decentralized and distributed digital ledger that records transactions across multiple
		computers securely and transparently. Unlike traditional databases maintained by a single authority, blockchain
		uses a network of nodes (computers) to ensure that no single entity controls the data. The data is stored in
		blocks that are linked or "chained" together chronologically using cryptographic techniques.
	</p>

	<h3 style="color: #2980b9; font-size: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 10px">Key Features of Blockchain</h3>
	<ul style="margin-bottom: 20px; list-style-type: disc; padding-left: 20px">
		<li>
			<strong>Decentralization:</strong> Blockchain eliminates the need for a central authority, enabling
			peer-to-peer interactions without intermediaries.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Transparency:</strong> Transactions recorded on a blockchain are visible to all participants in the
			network, fostering trust and accountability.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Immutability:</strong> Once a transaction is added to the blockchain, it cannot be altered or
			deleted, ensuring data integrity.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Security:</strong> Advanced cryptographic algorithms protect blockchain data from unauthorized
			access and tampering.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Smart Contracts:</strong> Blockchain supports programmable contracts that automatically execute
			predefined actions when certain conditions are met.
		</li>
	</ul>

	<h3 style="color: #2980b9; font-size: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 10px">How Blockchain Works</h3>
	<ol style="margin-bottom: 20px; list-style-type: decimal; padding-left: 20px">
		<li>
			<strong>Transaction Initiation:</strong> A user initiates a transaction, such as transferring cryptocurrency
			or recording a contract.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Verification by Nodes:</strong> The transaction is broadcast to a network of nodes, which verify its
			validity using consensus mechanisms like Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS).
		</li>
		<li><strong>Block Creation:</strong> Validated transactions are grouped into a block.</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Block Addition to the Chain:</strong> The new block is added to the existing chain of blocks in a
			chronological and tamper-proof manner.
		</li>
		<li><strong>Confirmation:</strong> The transaction is confirmed and becomes visible across the network.</li>
	</ol>

	<h3 style="color: #2980b9; font-size: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 10px">Types of Blockchains</h3>
	<ul style="margin-bottom: 20px; list-style-type: disc; padding-left: 20px">
