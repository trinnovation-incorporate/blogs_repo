			<p>
				A plant-based diet is one that primarily focuses on whole, plant-based foods such as fruits, vegetables,
				whole grains, legumes, nuts, and seeds. It excludes or minimizes animal products, such as meat, dairy,
				and eggs. This eating pattern is associated with various health benefits and environmental advantages.
