	<h2>Starting the Career</h2>
	<p>
		Gautam's initial days in Mumbai were marked by struggle. He didn't have a significant network or the capital to
		start his own business. He initially worked as a diamond sorter for a brief period, gaining valuable experience

		ventured into the import and export business.

		His first big break came in 1985 when he started his own diamond trading business, Adani Exports, now known as
		Adani Enterprises. Despite the lack of financial resources and a vast network, Gautam's resilience and keen
		understanding of business trends helped him secure contracts for exporting commodities, including agricultural
		products. The company steadily grew, and Gautam started building a reputation in the global trade market.
