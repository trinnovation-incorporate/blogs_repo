	<h2 id="introduction" style="font-size: 24px; color: #2c3e50">1. Introduction to Multithreading</h2>
	<p style="font-size: 16px">
		In modern software development, performance is a key consideration. Applications are expected to run smoothly
		and handle multiple tasks concurrently without delay. Multithreading is a technique that allows multiple
		sequences of instructions to be executed concurrently within the same application. This enables programs to
		handle multiple tasks efficiently, making better use of CPU cores and system resources.
	</p>

	<h2 id="thread" style="font-size: 24px; color: #2c3e50">2. What is a Thread?</h2>
	<p style="font-size: 16px">
		A thread is the smallest unit of execution within a program. In most systems, a thread runs within the context
		of a process, sharing the same memory and resources. Unlike processes, which have their own memory space,
		threads share resources with other threads in the same process, allowing for faster context switching and
		communication between them.
	</p>

	<h2 id="multithreading-vs-multiprocessing" style="font-size: 24px; color: #2c3e50">
		3. Multithreading vs. Multiprocessing
	</h2>
	<p style="font-size: 16px">Though they sound similar, multithreading and multiprocessing are distinct concepts:</p>
	<ul style="padding-left: 20px">
		<li style="padding: 5px 0">
			Multithreading involves running multiple threads within a single process, sharing the same memory space.
		</li>
		<li style="padding: 5px 0">
			Multiprocessing involves running multiple processes, each with its own memory space, typically across
			multiple CPU cores.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p style="font-size: 16px">
		While multiprocessing provides complete isolation between tasks, multithreading offers faster communication
		between threads since they share the same memory.
	</p>

	<h2 id="how-it-works" style="font-size: 24px; color: #2c3e50">4. How Multithreading Works</h2>
	<p style="font-size: 16px">
		Multithreading works by dividing a program into threads that can be executed concurrently. These threads can be
		run on different CPU cores or interleaved on a single core through time slicing. A thread scheduler, part of the
		operating system, decides how threads are allocated to available cores and manages their execution.
	</p>

	<h2 id="advantages" style="font-size: 24px; color: #2c3e50">5. Advantages of Multithreading</h2>
	<h3 style="font-size: 20px; color: #34495e">A. Improved Performance</h3>
	<p style="font-size: 16px">
		By running tasks concurrently, multithreading can speed up the overall execution of a program, particularly on
		multi-core systems. Each thread can perform a different task, such as data fetching, rendering, or computation.
	</p>

	<h3 style="font-size: 20px; color: #34495e">B. Better Resource Utilization</h3>
	<p style="font-size: 16px">
		Multithreading maximizes the use of available system resources. For example, while one thread waits for
		input/output operations to complete, another thread can continue processing, preventing idle CPU time.
	</p>

	<h3 style="font-size: 20px; color: #34495e">C. Responsiveness in Applications</h3>
	<p style="font-size: 16px">
		In user-facing applications, multithreading allows for a more responsive interface. While the main thread
		handles user input, background threads can process tasks like loading data or making network requests, ensuring
		the UI doesnâ€™t freeze during long-running operations.
	</p>

	<h2 id="challenges" style="font-size: 24px; color: #2c3e50">6. Challenges in Multithreading</h2>
	<h3 style="font-size: 20px; color: #34495e">A. Race Conditions</h3>
	<p style="font-size: 16px">
		A race condition occurs when two or more threads access shared data simultaneously, and the outcome depends on
		the order in which the threads execute. This can lead to unpredictable results or corrupted data.
	</p>

	<h3 style="font-size: 20px; color: #34495e">B. Deadlocks</h3>
	<p style="font-size: 16px">
		A deadlock occurs when two or more threads are waiting for each other to release resources, causing the threads
		to be permanently blocked. Deadlocks are challenging to detect and can severely impact the performance of an
		application.
	</p>

	<h3 style="font-size: 20px; color: #34495e">C. Thread Synchronization Issues</h3>
	<p style="font-size: 16px">
		Ensuring that multiple threads can safely access shared resources is difficult. Incorrect synchronization can
		result in data inconsistencies and application crashes.
	</p>

	<h2 id="lifecycle" style="font-size: 24px; color: #2c3e50">7. Thread Life Cycle</h2>
	<h3 style="font-size: 20px; color: #34495e">A. New</h3>
	<p style="font-size: 16px">A thread is created but has not yet started executing.</p>

	<h3 style="font-size: 20px; color: #34495e">B. Runnable</h3>
	<p style="font-size: 16px">The thread is ready to run and is waiting to be scheduled by the operating system.</p>

	<h3 style="font-size: 20px; color: #34495e">C. Running</h3>
	<p style="font-size: 16px">The thread is actively executing its instructions.</p>

	<h3 style="font-size: 20px; color: #34495e">D. Waiting/Blocked</h3>
	<p style="font-size: 16px">
		The thread is waiting for some condition to be met or for a resource to become available.
	</p>

	<h3 style="font-size: 20px; color: #34495e">E. Terminated</h3>
	<p style="font-size: 16px">The thread has finished its execution and is no longer active.</p>

	<h2 id="models" style="font-size: 24px; color: #2c3e50">8. Types of Multithreading Models</h2>
	<h3 style="font-size: 20px; color: #34495e">A. Many-to-One Model</h3>
	<p style="font-size: 16px">
		In this model, multiple user-level threads are mapped to a single kernel thread. It is not widely used due to
		performance limitations.
	</p>

	<h3 style="font-size: 20px; color: #34495e">B. One-to-One Model</h3>
	<p style="font-size: 16px">
		This model maps each user thread to a kernel thread, allowing for more efficient use of CPU cores but requiring
		more overhead in managing the threads.
	</p>

	<h3 style="font-size: 20px; color: #34495e">C. Many-to-Many Model</h3>
	<p style="font-size: 16px">
		Multiple user threads are mapped to multiple kernel threads, providing a balance between system resource usage
		and performance.
	</p>

	<h2 id="synchronization" style="font-size: 24px; color: #2c3e50">9. Thread Synchronization Mechanisms</h2>
	<h3 style="font-size: 20px; color: #34495e">A. Mutex (Mutual Exclusion)</h3>
	<p style="font-size: 16px">
		A mutex ensures that only one thread can access a resource at a time. Other threads trying to access the
		resource will be blocked until the mutex is released.
	</p>

	<h3 style="font-size: 20px; color: #34495e">B. Semaphores</h3>
	<p style="font-size: 16px">
		A semaphore is a signaling mechanism used to control access to a resource by multiple threads.
	</p>

	<h3 style="font-size: 20px; color: #34495e">C. Monitors</h3>
	<p style="font-size: 16px">
		Monitors provide a higher-level synchronization primitive, typically used in object-oriented languages, that
		ensures safe access to shared resources.
	</p>

	<h3 style="font-size: 20px; color: #34495e">D. Locks</h3>
	<p style="font-size: 16px">
		Locks prevent multiple threads from accessing shared resources at the same time, helping to avoid race
		conditions and data corruption.
	</p>

	<h2 id="best-practices" style="font-size: 24px; color: #2c3e50">10. Best Practices in Multithreading</h2>
	<h3 style="font-size: 20px; color: #34495e">A. Avoid Shared State Between Threads</h3>
	<p style="font-size: 16px">
		Sharing state between threads can lead to synchronization issues and race conditions. Wherever possible, avoid
		shared data or use synchronization mechanisms to protect it.
	</p>

	<h3 style="font-size: 20px; color: #34495e">B. Use Thread Pools</h3>
	<p style="font-size: 16px">
		Thread pools allow for efficient management of a fixed number of threads, reducing the overhead of creating and
		destroying threads on demand.
	</p>

	<h3 style="font-size: 20px; color: #34495e">C. Opt for Immutable Data Structures</h3>
	<p style="font-size: 16px">
		Using immutable objects can simplify thread synchronization, as immutable data cannot be changed after creation,
		making it inherently thread-safe.
	</p>

	<h2 id="languages" style="font-size: 24px; color: #2c3e50">11. Programming Languages and Multithreading</h2>
	<h3 style="font-size: 20px; color: #34495e">A. Java</h3>
	<p style="font-size: 16px">
		Java offers rich support for multithreading through its java.lang.Thread class and java.util.concurrent package,
		which provides high-level abstractions like thread pools and locks.
	</p>

	<h3 style="font-size: 20px; color: #34495e">B. Python</h3>
	<p style="font-size: 16px">
		Python supports multithreading, but the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) can be a bottleneck in CPU-bound tasks.
		For I/O-bound tasks, however, Pythonâ€™s multithreading can still offer significant performance improvements.
	</p>

	<h3 style="font-size: 20px; color: #34495e">C. C++</h3>
	<p style="font-size: 16px">
		C++ supports multithreading via the std::thread library, providing low-level control over thread creation,
		management, and synchronization.
	</p>

	<h2 id="real-time" style="font-size: 24px; color: #2c3e50">12. Multithreading in Real-Time Systems</h2>
	<p style="font-size: 16px">
		In real-time systems, multithreading is crucial for ensuring that tasks are completed within specific time
		constraints. Threads can be assigned different priorities based on the criticality of the task they perform,
		ensuring that high-priority tasks are executed in a timely manner.
	</p>

	<h2 id="modern-cpus" style="font-size: 24px; color: #2c3e50">13. Multithreading in Modern CPUs</h2>
	<p style="font-size: 16px">
		Modern CPUs are designed with multiple cores and hyper-threading technology to support concurrent thread
		execution. Hyper-threading enables each core to handle multiple threads, further improving performance by making
		efficient use of CPU resources.
	</p>

	<h2 id="conclusion" style="font-size: 24px; color: #2c3e50">15. Conclusion</h2>
