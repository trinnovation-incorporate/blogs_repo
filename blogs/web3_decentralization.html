	</p>

	<h2>1. Understanding the Evolution of the Web</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<b>Web1 (1990-2004): The Static Web:</b> This was the initial phase of the internet, characterized by static
			web pages with limited interactivity. Users were primarily consumers of content, with few opportunities for
			interaction or content creation. Think of personal websites with basic information, online directories, and
			simple forums.
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Web2 (2004-Present): The Social Web:</b> This era brought about dynamic and interactive websites,
			user-generated content, and the rise of social media platforms. Companies like Facebook, YouTube, and
			Twitter became central hubs for online interaction, connecting billions of users worldwide. However, this
			centralization also led to concerns about data privacy, censorship, and the immense power wielded by these
			tech giants.
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Web3 (Present-Future): The Decentralized Web:</b> Web3 aims to address the limitations of Web2 by
			leveraging decentralized technologies like blockchain, cryptocurrencies, and distributed systems. It
			envisions a more democratic and user-centric internet where individuals have greater control over their
			data, identity, and online experiences.
		</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>2. Core Concepts of Web3</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<b>Decentralization:</b> This is the foundational principle of Web3. Instead of relying on centralized
			servers and databases controlled by single entities, Web3 utilizes distributed networks where data is spread
			across multiple nodes. This eliminates single points of failure and reduces the risk of censorship or
			control by any one party.
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Blockchain Technology:</b> Blockchain is a distributed, immutable ledger that records transactions across
			a network of computers. It provides transparency, security, and trust, making it a crucial building block
			for Web3 applications. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum are built on blockchain technology.
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Cryptocurrencies and Tokens:</b> Cryptocurrencies are digital or virtual currencies that use cryptography
			for security. They enable peer-to-peer transactions without the need for intermediaries like banks. Tokens,
			on the other hand, represent a digital asset or utility within a specific ecosystem. They can be used for
			governance, access to services, or representing ownership of digital or physical assets.
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Smart Contracts:</b> These are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written
			into code. They automatically enforce the contract when predetermined conditions are met, eliminating the
			need for intermediaries and reducing the risk of fraud or disputes.
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs):</b> DAOs are community-led entities with rules encoded on
			a blockchain. They operate autonomously without central authority, enabling collective decision-making and
			governance through token-based voting.
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Semantic Web:</b> This concept aims to make internet data more understandable to machines by using
			metadata and ontologies. This allows for more efficient data processing and enables AI and machine learning
			applications to better understand and utilize information on the web.
		</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>3. Key Technologies Driving Web3</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<b>Blockchain:</b> As mentioned earlier, blockchain provides the foundation for secure, transparent, and
			tamper-proof data storage and transactions. Different types of blockchains exist, each with its own
			characteristics and use cases.
			<ul>
				<li>
					<b>Public Blockchains:</b> These are open and permissionless, allowing anyone to participate in the
					network. Bitcoin and Ethereum are examples of public blockchains.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Private Blockchains:</b> These are permissioned, requiring authorization to join the network.
					They are often used by organizations for internal data management and secure transactions.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Consortium Blockchains:</b> These are semi-private, governed by a group of organizations. They
					offer a balance between control and decentralization.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Interplanetary File System (IPFS):</b> IPFS is a decentralized storage system that uses
			content-addressing instead of location-addressing. This means that files are identified by their content
			rather than their location on a server, making them more resistant to censorship and single points of
			failure.
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM):</b> The EVM is a runtime environment for smart contracts on the Ethereum
			blockchain. It allows developers to create and deploy decentralized applications (dApps) that run on the
			blockchain.
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Decentralized Identity (DID):</b> DIDs are self-sovereign digital identities that are not controlled by
			any central authority. They allow individuals to manage their own identity and data, providing greater
			privacy and control.
		</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>4. Use Cases and Applications of Web3</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<b>Decentralized Finance (DeFi):</b> DeFi aims to recreate traditional financial services like lending,
			borrowing, and trading on a decentralized blockchain. It offers greater transparency, accessibility, and
			efficiency compared to traditional finance.
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs):</b> NFTs are unique digital assets that represent ownership of items like
			digital art, collectibles, and virtual real estate. They provide provable ownership and scarcity, creating
			new possibilities for creators and collectors.
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Metaverse:</b> The metaverse is a persistent, shared virtual world where users can interact with each
			other and digital objects. Web3 technologies can enable decentralized ownership of virtual assets and create
			more immersive and user-controlled metaverse experiences.
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Decentralized Social Media:</b> These platforms aim to give users more control over their data and
			content, reducing censorship and platform control. They often use blockchain-based governance mechanisms to
