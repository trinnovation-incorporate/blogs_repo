	During the 1970s, unmanned probes revolutionized our understanding of the solar system. NASA’s Voyager 1 and Voyager
	2 missions, launched in 1977, provided unprecedented data on the outer planets and their moons. Viking 1 and Viking
	2 missions to Mars in the 1970s also sought signs of life, pioneering planetary exploration and setting the stage
	for future robotic missions. The development of robotic rovers, such as Spirit and Opportunity in the early 2000s,
	allowed scientists to study Mars up close, analyzing soil, rocks, and the planet’s potential for life.
</p>

<h3>Space Telescopes and Cosmic Observation:</h3>
<p>
	The launch of the Hubble Space Telescope in 1990 changed astronomy forever. Orbiting Earth, it provided
	crystal-clear images of distant galaxies, nebulae, and stars, vastly expanding our understanding of the universe’s
	age, size, and structure. Other space-based observatories followed, allowing scientists to peer deeper into space,
	study black holes, and explore the formation of galaxies, while eliminating the atmospheric interference that
	hindered ground-based telescopes.
</p>

<h3>Space Stations and Long-Duration Human Presence:</h3>
<p>
	The Soviet Salyut program in the 1970s and 1980s paved the way for long-duration human presence in space. This was
	followed by the Mir space station, which hosted international crews and facilitated groundbreaking scientific
	research. The International Space Station (ISS), initiated in 1998, took space collaboration to new heights. An
	international effort, it involved NASA, Roscosmos, ESA, JAXA, and CSA, and has since become the hub for research and
	experimentation in microgravity, providing invaluable knowledge for future space missions.
</p>

<h2>III. The New Space Age: Commercialization and a Renewed Focus on Human Exploration (2000-Present)</h2>

<h3>The Rise of Private Space Companies:</h3>
<p>
	The early 21st century marked a shift towards privatization in space exploration. Companies like SpaceX
	revolutionized the industry with the development of reusable rockets, cutting costs and increasing access to space.
	SpaceX’s Falcon 9 became the first privately developed rocket to send astronauts to the ISS in 2020, showcasing the
	potential of commercial spaceflight. Blue Origin, founded by Jeff Bezos, focused on suborbital space tourism and
	orbital spaceflight, while other companies, such as Virgin Galactic, entered the space tourism sector, further
	pushing the boundaries of space accessibility.
</p>

<h3>A Return to the Moon (Artemis Program):</h3>
<p>
	NASA’s Artemis program, launched in 2019, set its sights on returning humans to the Moon by 2024, with an emphasis
	on establishing a sustainable presence. The program will rely on new lunar landers and the Gateway space station, a
	lunar orbiting outpost to support long-term exploration. The collaboration with international partners, including
	the European Space Agency and private sector companies, will play a crucial role in achieving these ambitious goals.
</p>

<h3>Interplanetary Ambitions: Mars and Beyond:</h3>
<p>
