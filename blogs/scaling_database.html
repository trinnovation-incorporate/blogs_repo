		Imagine you are developing an application that requires storing <strong>user information</strong>. When your
		application has only a few hundred users, it’s manageable to keep all the data on a single database server.
	</p>

	<p style="font-size: 18px; margin-bottom: 20px">
		However, as your application expands and you gain more users, the need for
		<strong>additional data storage</strong> becomes crucial. Failing to scale your database to meet the increased
		demand could <strong>slow down</strong> your application and lead to various issues.
	</p>

	<p style="font-size: 18px; margin-bottom: 30px">
		In this article, we will discuss <strong>8 strategies</strong> for scaling databases to ensure your application
		maintains optimal performance, preventing the database from becoming a bottleneck.

			1. Vertical Scaling
		</h2>

			style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; margin-bottom: 20px"
		/>
		<p style="font-size: 16px">
			Vertical scaling means adding more resources (such as CPU, RAM, and storage) to a single database server.
			This approach can be a quick and straightforward solution for a <strong>smaller database</strong>, but it
			comes with its own limitations.
		</p>
		<p style="font-size: 16px">
			It can quickly become <strong>costly</strong>, and there are limits to how much you can scale up. Moreover,
			vertical scaling introduces a <strong>single point of failure</strong>, meaning that if this server goes
			down, your entire application could be affected.
		</p>
		<p style="font-size: 16px">
			<strong>Example:</strong> A small e-commerce website might face increased traffic during holiday sales. To
			handle this surge, they could vertically scale their database server by adding more RAM to manage the extra
			load.

			2. Indexing
		</h2>
		<p style="font-size: 16px">
			Just like the index at the back of a book helps you quickly find specific information,
			<strong>database indexes</strong> allow you to locate data rapidly without scanning every single row in a
			table.
		</p>
		<p style="font-size: 16px">
			Indexes are typically created on the <strong>most frequently queried columns</strong> to enhance read
			performance. However, it’s essential to note that over-indexing may degrade write performance due to
			increased overhead.

			3. Sharding
		</h2>
		<p style="font-size: 16px">
			A single machine has its limits when it comes to storing data. As your application attracts more users, you
			might face space constraints and reduced performance.
		</p>
		<p style="font-size: 16px">
			To prevent this issue, you can divide the data into <strong>smaller pieces (shards)</strong> and distribute
			them across different servers. This technique is known as <strong>Database Sharding</strong>.

			alt="Database Sharding"
			style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; margin-top: 20px"
		/>
		<p style="font-size: 16px">
			By distributing the data in this manner, it becomes easier to scale and accommodate more users efficiently.

			4. Vertical Partitioning
		</h2>
		<p style="font-size: 16px">
			When certain columns are accessed more frequently than others, it’s beneficial to split the database table
			into smaller tables, each containing a subset of the columns from the original table.
		</p>
		<p style="font-size: 16px">
			This strategy helps minimize the amount of data read during queries, potentially improving performance for
			specific access patterns.
		</p>
		<p style="font-size: 16px">
			<strong>Example:</strong> An e-commerce application could split its product table into:
		</p>
		<ul style="font-size: 16px">
			<li>A "core_product" table with frequently accessed data (ID, name, price, category).</li>
			<li>A "product_details" table with less frequently accessed data (description, specifications).</li>
			<li>A "product_media" table for large binary data (images, videos).</li>
		</ul>

			5. Caching
		</h2>
		<p style="font-size: 16px">
			In nearly all major applications, certain data is accessed more frequently than others.
		</p>
		<p style="font-size: 16px">For instance:</p>
		<ul style="font-size: 16px">
			<li>In a blogging app, some articles are read more frequently than others.</li>
			<li>In a social media platform, specific users may be more active.</li>
			<li>In a streaming service, some movies are more popular than others.</li>
		</ul>
		<p style="font-size: 16px">
			It’s wise to store this frequently accessed data in a <strong>faster storage layer</strong>, enhancing
			access speed and alleviating the load on the database.
		</p>
		<img
			src="assets/scaling_database/cache.webp"
			alt="Caching"
			style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; margin-top: 20px"
		/>
		<p style="font-size: 16px">
			This method is known as <strong>caching</strong>, a widely used technique to expedite queries for
			often-accessed data.

			6. Replication
		</h2>
		<p style="font-size: 16px">
			When your database servers are confined to one region, users from other areas may encounter increased
			latency.
		</p>
		<p style="font-size: 16px">
			To address this issue, we can replicate the primary database across various regions and manage
			<strong>read requests</strong> locally.
		</p>
		<p style="font-size: 16px">This approach is termed <strong>Database Replication</strong>.</p>
		<p style="font-size: 16px">
			Essentially, database replication involves creating and maintaining multiple copies (replicas) of a database
			across different servers or locations to enhance read performance, ensure high availability, and facilitate
			disaster recovery.
		</p>
		<p style="font-size: 16px">
			These replicas are synchronized with the primary database, ensuring data consistency.
		</p>
		<img
			src="assets/scaling_database/database-replication.jpg"
			alt="Database Replication"
			style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; margin-top: 20px"
		/>
		<p style="font-size: 16px">
			<strong>Types of Replication:</strong>
		</p>
		<ol style="font-size: 16px">
			<li>
				<strong>Synchronous Replication:</strong> Changes made to the primary database are immediately
				replicated to all replicas before a transaction is deemed complete. This ensures strong data consistency
				but may affect performance due to the added overhead.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Asynchronous Replication:</strong> Changes to the primary database are queued for replication to
				replicas, allowing the primary to continue processing without waiting for confirmation. This can lead to
				temporary data inconsistencies but enhances performance.
			</li>
		</ol>

			7. Load Balancing
		</h2>
		<p style="font-size: 16px">
			Even with scaling strategies in place, a sudden surge in traffic could overload your database servers.
		</p>
		<p style="font-size: 16px">
			To manage this, <strong>load balancing</strong> can be employed to distribute incoming requests across
			multiple servers, preventing any single server from becoming overwhelmed.
		</p>
		<img
			src="assets/scaling_database/load-balancer.webp"
			alt="Load Balancer"
			style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; margin-top: 20px"
		/>
		<p style="font-size: 16px">
			By balancing the load, we can ensure consistent performance, especially during peak usage times.

			8. Data Archiving
		</h2>
		<p style="font-size: 16px">
			As time passes, certain data may become less relevant or infrequently accessed. Keeping this data in your
			primary database can affect performance and increase storage costs.
		</p>
		<p style="font-size: 16px">
			To optimize your database, you can implement a <strong>data archiving strategy</strong>, moving outdated
			data to a separate storage solution, thus keeping your primary database streamlined and efficient.
		</p>
		<p style="font-size: 16px">
			<strong>Example:</strong> An organization might archive historical records of user interactions after a set
			period, maintaining only recent activity in the main database for immediate access.
		</p>
	</section>

	<p style="font-size: 18px; margin-top: 30px">
		Implementing these strategies effectively allows you to maintain the performance and availability of your
		database as your application grows, providing a seamless experience for your users.
