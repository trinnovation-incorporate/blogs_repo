I have been building blogs and websites since 2002. In that time I have launched several of my own blogs, and helped hundreds of others do the same.</p><p>I know that starting a blog can seem overwhelming and intimidating. <strong>This free guide is all about blogging for beginners</strong>, and will teach you how to become a blogger with just the most basic computer skills. So whether you’re 8 or 88, you can create your own blog in 20 minutes.</p><p>I am not ashamed to admit that when I was first learning how to build a blog I made a ton of mistakes. You can benefit from more than a decade of my experience so that you don’t repeat these same mistakes when you make your own blog. I created this free guide so that a complete beginner can learn how to blog quickly and easily.</p><p>So, just <em>how do you start a blog?</em></p><p>Learn how to create a blog in about 20 minutes following these steps:</p><h2>How to Start a Blog in 6 Steps</h2><ol><li><a href="#step1">Pick a blog name.</a> Choose a descriptive name for your blog.</li><li><a href="#step2">Get your blog online.</a> Register your blog and get hosting.</li><li><a href="#step3">Customize your blog.</a> Choose a free blog design template and tweak it.</li><li><a href="#step4">Write &amp; publish your first post.</a> Share your thoughts with the world. The fun part!</li><li><a href="#step5">Promote your blog.</a> Get more people to read your blog with the proper marketing.</li><li><a href="#step6">Make money blogging.</a> Choose from several options to monetize your blog.</li></ol><h3>Should you start a blog?</h3><p>One of the misconceptions about starting a blog is that you need to be a great writer to be successful. Nothing could be further from the truth. People read blog sites to get a personal perspective on things, so most bloggers write in a very informal and conversational style.</p><p>And because of the format, many successful bloggers will <strong>write about a variety of topics</strong> on the same blog.</p><p>In addition, you don’t need to be an expert on any of the topics you write about to have a successful blog. For example, visitors to a cooking blog don’t want to read a textbook from a food scientist, they want to hear the experiences of someone who has actually cooked some real meals, mistakes and all.</p><p><strong>To be successful as a blogger there is really just one requirement: a passion for your topic.</strong></p><p>At its heart, blogging is about sharing your knowledge with the world. Writing about things that you are passionate about makes the process of starting a successful blog so much easier. As long as you are writing about things that you are genuinely interested in, your passion will shine through and keep your visitors interested.</p><p>So why would you go to the trouble of blogging? There are a few reasons:</p><ul><li><strong>Share your story.</strong> A blog allows you to have a voice and be heard. You can share your story with the entire world if you so choose. One of the most common ways blogs are used are as a diary where the blogger writes about their daily experiences so that friends, family, and others can all be a part of their lives.</li><li><strong>Make money from home.</strong> Blogging can be quite lucrative if done correctly. The top bloggers in the world obviously earn quite a bit, but even a part-time blogger can expect to make a nice profit if things are done correctly. The best part about it is that blogging is a form of passive income, since you can spend just a few hours a week writing a piece of content and then continue to profit from it long after the the writing is finished. I go into much more detail on how to blog for money later in this guide.</li><li><strong>Recognition for yourself or your business.</strong> No, you probably won’t have paparazzi following you around because of your latest post. But a successful blog makes your idea into a reality, and can gain you a ton of recognition in your respective field. Many bloggers are known as experts just because of their blogs, and some have even gotten book and movie deals based on their blogs.</li><li><strong>Find a community.</strong> Blogging at its heart is interactive. You write a post and people comment on it. This is a good way to connect with people who are interested in the same things as you are. Blogging allows you to teach these people based on your experience, and it gives you the opportunity to learn from your readers as well.</li></ul><p><strong>Ready to begin?</strong> <a href="#step1"><strong>Click here to go to Step #1 of the guide</strong></a></p><p></p><h3>What is a blog anyway?</h3><p>In short, <strong>a blog is a type of website that focuses mainly on written content</strong>, also known as blog posts. In popular culture we most often hear about news blogs or celebrity blog sites, but as you’ll see in this guide, you can start a successful blog on just about any topic imaginable.</p><p>Bloggers often write from a personal perspective that allows them to connect directly with their readers. In addition, most blogs also have a “comments” section where visitors can correspond with the blogger. Interacting with your visitors in the comments section helps to further the connection between the blogger and the reader.</p><p>This direct connection to the reader is one of the main benefits of starting a blog. This connection allows you to interact and share ideas with other like-minded people. It also allows you to build trust with your readers. Having the trust and loyalty of your readers also opens up the door to making money from your blog, which is something I discuss later in this guide.</p><p>The good news is that the internet is exploding with growth right now. More people than ever are online. This explosion in growth means more potential readers for your blog. In short, if you are thinking about starting a blog then there is no better time than right now.<a name="step1"></a></p><p><strong>Let’s start your blog!</strong></p><p></p><h2>Step 1: Pick a blog name</h2><p>If you are not sure what to name your blog, or what topic to blog about, skip to the <a href="#blogname">next section</a>.</p><p>If you’ve already got an idea for the name of your blog, you can check to make sure that no one else has already registered it:</p><h3 class="domain-check-header">See if your blog name is available:</h3><div class="domain-check"><form id="domain-check-form" method="post"><input id="input_domain_name" style="font-size: 13px;" name="input_domain_name" type="text" placeholder=" Enter blog name &amp; extension here..."><br><input id="input_domain_submit" name="input_domain_submit" type="submit" value="check availability"></form><div class="domain_check_result">&nbsp;</div></div><p><strong>Note: You cannot use any spaces or punctuation other than dashes in a domain name.</strong></p><p>If you find that the name you wanted is already taken there are a few things you can do:</p><ul><li><strong>Try a different domain extension.</strong> If the .com version is already registered you may still be able to get the .net or .org version of the name.</li><p><a name="blogname"></a></p><li><strong>Add small words.</strong> Words like “a”, “my”, “best”, or “the”. For example, this site is called TheBlogStarter.com instead of BlogStarter.com.</li><li><strong>Add dashes between words.</strong> For example, scott-chow.com</li></ul><h3>How to Choose a Blog Topic &amp; Name</h3><p>If you don’t have an idea for a name already, the first step is choosing your blog topic.</p><p>If you’re not sure what to blog about, there are <u>a few ways to find a good blog topic</u>:</p><ul><li><strong>Life experiences.</strong> Everyone has lessons they have learned through life experience. Sharing this knowledge can be incredibly helpful to others in similar situations. <br>For example, I recently helped a woman start her blog about being a fireman’s wife. She has a lot of experience and knowledge to share with others about this topic, and it has helped her connect with others in similar situations. <br>Think about the things you have experienced in life. This could be related to your family (example: a blog about being a stay at home mom), work (a blog about experiences dealing with clients), or other life experiences (a blog about dealing with a troubling time such as a disease or divorce, or about a happy time such as preparing for a wedding or a birth of a child).</li><li><strong>A personal blog.</strong> A personal blog is a blog all about you. This will include a variety of topics, from things you do on a daily basis, to random thoughts and musings. This is a great way to share your thoughts with the world without having to stick to just one topic.</li><li><strong>Hobbies &amp; passions.</strong> Hobbies or other interests you are passionate about are a great place to start. Cooking, travel, fashion, sports, and cars are all classic examples. But even blogs about more obscure hobbies can be successful, since the your audience is literally anyone in the world with the internet.</li></ul><p>Once you have a topic it’s time to choose your blog name, also known as your domain name.</p><p><strong>A good blog name should be descriptive</strong> so that potential visitors can instantly tell what your blog is about just from the name.</p><p>If you are blogging about one specific topic then you will definitely want to include that in some way when you pick a domain name. Try not to get hung-up on just one word though. For example, a cooking blog doesn’t necessarily have to have the word “cooking” in it. The words “food”, “recipes”, and “meals” would also let people know that your blog is about cooking.</p><p>If you are planning to create a personal blog where you discuss a variety of topics then I recommend using your name, or some variation of it, since your blog is all about you. For example, I own the blog scottchow.com. You can also add your middle name or middle initial if you find your name is already taken. Or you could use a variation like “Scott Chow Blog” or “Blogging with Scott”.</p><p></p><p><strong>Can’t decide on a good name for your blog? <a href="https://www.theblogstarter.com/contact-me/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Contact me</a> and I will help you personally (for free)!</strong></p><p>Once you have some name ideas you will need to <strong>choose a domain extension</strong>.<br>A .com domain extension is the most preferred, but .net or .org work as well. It is also important to note that for the purposes of a blog domain you cannot have any spaces between words. <a name="step2"></a>So “Blogging with Scott” becomes bloggingwithscott.com</p><h2>Step 2: Get your blog online</h2><p>Now that you’ve got a name picked out it’s time to get your blog online. This might sound hard or technical, but the steps below will walk you right through and <em>make the process easy</em>.</p><p><img decoding="async" class="alignright size-full wp-image-1423" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20292%20256'%3E%3C/svg%3E" alt="Simple steps to help you create a blog easily" width="292" height="256" data-lazy-src="https://www.theblogstarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/start-your-first-blog.png"><noscript><img decoding="async" class="alignright size-full wp-image-1423" src="https://www.theblogstarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/start-your-first-blog.png" alt="Simple steps to help you create a blog easily" width="292" height="256"></noscript>To get your blog up and running you need two things: blog hosting (also known as web hosting) and blogging software. The good news is that these typically come packaged together.</p><p>A blog host is a company that stores all of the files for your blog and delivers them to the user when they type in your blog name. <strong>You must have a blog host in order to have a blog</strong>.</p><p>You also need to have the software to build your blog. In this guide I will be showing you how to build a blog using the WordPress blogging software, because it is the most popular, customizable, and easiest to use.</p><p>The web host I recommend, and the one I show you how to use in this guide, is <a href="https://www.theblogstarter.com/go/bluehost/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BlueHost</a>. I personally use BlueHost and I recommend them for all new bloggers because:</p><ul><li>They will <strong>register your custom domain name for free</strong>, making sure no one else can take it.</li><li>They have a <strong>30 day money back guarantee</strong> if you are unsatisfied for any reason.</li><li>They offer a free, automatic installation of the WordPress blogging software (which I show you how to use in this guide).</li><li>They offer <u>reliable</u> web hosting that has been recommended by WordPress since 2005 and they currently host over 2 million blogs and websites.</li><li>They have helpful <strong>24/7 customer service</strong> via phone or web chat.</li></ul><p>Use any <a href="https://www.theblogstarter.com/go/bluehost/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BlueHost link</a> on this site by September 10th to get the special Fall Sale price of $1.99 per month.</p><p><strong>Disclosure:</strong> BlueHost compensates The Blog Starter when you purchase through <a href="https://www.theblogstarter.com/go/bluehost/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this link</a>, so my services are free of charge to you!

To change your theme you are going to click on the “Appearance” tab on the left menu.</p><p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2298" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20600%20281'%3E%3C/svg%3E" alt="How to choose a theme" width="600" height="281" data-lazy-srcset="https://www.theblogstarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/wordpress-theme-install-1.png 600w, https://www.theblogstarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/wordpress-theme-install-1-300x141.png 300w" data-lazy-sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-lazy-src="https://www.theblogstarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/wordpress-theme-install-1.png"><noscript><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2298" src="https://www.theblogstarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/wordpress-theme-install-1.png" alt="How to choose a theme" width="600" height="281" srcset="https://www.theblogstarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/wordpress-theme-install-1.png 600w, https://www.theblogstarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/wordpress-theme-install-1-300x141.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></noscript></p><p>You will see several free WordPress themes are already installed on your blog: Twenty Seventeen, Twenty Sixteen, etc. These are well-designed, clean-looking themes that can work for just about any type of blog.

The content on these pages is static, meaning – the content doesn’t change, or at least not very often. These are mainly top-level pages that can be accessed via a menu on your blog.</p><p>These static content pages should be in place well before you launch your blog to the world.</p><p>Important static pages to include:</p><ul><li><strong>About Me (Us)</strong> – This page should include a biographical summary of the author(s) as well as a mission statement. Think about the answers to these questions: <em>How did your passion for the subject matter develop?</em> <em>What do you want to convey to the world?</em> <em>What is your ultimate goal?</em></li><li><strong>Contact Me (Us)</strong> – A contact page provides the visitor a place to reach the author which, in turn, provides the visitor with the reassurance that you are a real and reachable author. You can add your physical address, phone number, and custom email address. Or you can utilize a simple contact form to keep your personal identifying information private. You should put links to all of your social media profiles here as well.</li></ul><p>Aside from your blog, which is generally introduced on the home/main page, these two all-important pages should be visible on your top (header) menu and easy to access.&nbsp; You can take a look at the top of this page to see how I have these pages included in the header menu.&nbsp; <a href="https://www.theblogstarter.com/step-4-configure-your-blog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">See this detailed guide to customizing your blog menus</a> if you need help.</p><p>Other static pages that are equally as important but less commonly thought of are:</p><ul><li><strong>Disclaimer Page</strong>: If you intend to monetize your blog, you must describe the ways you intend to generate income. This is an absolute must-have page that should not be overlooked, as per FTC guidelines. For example, if you are discussing and endorsing a product, and stand to profit by linking to the product, this relationship must be disclosed.</li><li><strong>Privacy Policy</strong>: If you collect data from your visitors in any way, you are required to add a privacy policy page that tells visitors exactly how you are collecting data, how you are using it, and if you are sharing that data. If you implement <a href="https://www.google.com/adsense/start/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Adsense</a> or a <a href="https://analytics.google.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Analytics</a> account on your blog, a Privacy Policy must be used. This page is required by the CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act) and the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation), and is included by default on your WordPress blog.</li><li><strong>Terms of Service</strong>: If your blog is also running a store or selling services, it is a good idea to have a Terms of Service page to lessen your potential liability.</li></ul><p>These required static pages are typically linked to in the footer menu of a blog. They should, at the very least, be visible and accessible from the home page.&nbsp; Again, look at the bottom of this page to see how this looks in practice.</p><p>There are other static pages you can choose to include depending on what suits your blog and business. Common static page examples are an advertising page to solicit paid advertisements, a donations page, a resource page to direct visitors to your favorite links within your field, and a page for submitting ideas and content.</p><p><strong><u>Dynamic Content:</u></strong> Your dynamic content is your blog and the most important content you have to offer. This is where you, as the creator, will infuse the blog with your brand of informative content that supplies your audience with knowledgeable tips, facts, opinions, and stories. This is how you engage your visitors and keep them coming back for more.</p><p>Your blog content should be regularly submitted at specific intervals. Waiting months to create content will never build a following. Posting content weekly and driving traffic to these posts will help build your brand.</p><h3>How to write great blog content</h3><p>Each post should be lengthy, informative, and engaging. It’s not always easy to come up with new blog post ideas on a regular basis and you are free to mix up the tone and even the subject matter to keep things lively and interesting. It’s your space, after all. But there are a few elements that each and every piece of content should endeavor to include.</p><p><strong>Define the Content:</strong> Create an alluring post title that stimulates curiosity and encourages clicks. Use the first paragraph of your post to clearly define the topic of your article and provide a possible hook to keep the reader reading.</p><p><strong>The Longer the Better – But Break It Up</strong>: The more information and detail you include, the better. But visitors will begin to skim if the content contains lengthy paragraphs a mile long, and will pop out faster than they came in. Visitors enjoy tidbits. Keep your paragraphs short with spaces in between, use lists and standout quotes, use images, and always include headings and sub-headings so that visitors can find what they’re looking for.</p><p><strong>Engage The Reader:</strong> At the end of each post, a common tactic used to engage visitors is posing a meaningful question to your audience and asking them to reply in the comments. This simple measure can increase engagement tenfold.</p><p><strong>Original Content:</strong> Your content should always be original. Never plagiarize – you will eventually be called out on it and could even face consequences. Your content should come from your heart, your brain, your knowledge base, and your experience. You can get topic ideas from others in your field, but make sure the content comes from you.</p><p><strong>Original Photos:</strong> While it is easy to include stock images from free image sites, it is even better to include your own photos and graphic work. Another idea is to take free images and manipulate them with a free photo editor.</p><p><strong>Edit Your Work: </strong>Your blog content should be sufficiently edited. Nothing says unprofessional like several typographical and grammatical errors. If you need a few refresher courses in grammar, consider using a writing application.</p><h3>Publishing Your Blog</h3><p>Even after you have written a post your blog may still be showing a placeholder page.</p><p>When you are ready to make your blog public for the first time, just click “Home” at the top left of the menu in your WordPress dashboard, and then click “Launch with confidence”.   Click the blue “Launch your site” button to remove the placeholder page and launch your blog.</p><p><a name="step5"></a><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3612" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20600%20635'%3E%3C/svg%3E" alt="launch your blog" width="600" height="635" data-lazy-src="https://www.theblogstarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/launch-blog.jpg"><noscript><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3612" src="https://www.theblogstarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/launch-blog.jpg" alt="launch your blog" width="600" height="635"></noscript></p><p>Congratulations! You now know how to start your own blog and publish content!</p><h2>Step 5: Promote your blog</h2><p>Creating a well-designed blog and writing great content is just the start. In order to get visitors to your blog you will need spend some time promoting it, especially when you first start.</p><p>The strategies below will help get your blog in front of more readers. You don’t need to use every strategy – try out a few and see what works well for you.</p><h4>Alert Your Inner Circle</h4><p>The very first people who should become aware of your blog are your inner circle. This includes family, friends, and colleagues within your field. Encourage them to become followers, ask them to mention your new blog, and – most importantly – thank them.</p><h4>Use Social Media</h4><p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3977" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20600%2095'%3E%3C/svg%3E" alt="social media promotion" width="600" height="95" data-lazy-srcset="https://www.theblogstarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/social-media-for-bloggers.png 600w, https://www.theblogstarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/social-media-for-bloggers-300x48.png 300w" data-lazy-sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-lazy-src="https://www.theblogstarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/social-media-for-bloggers.png"><noscript><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3977" src="https://www.theblogstarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/social-media-for-bloggers.png" alt="social media promotion" width="600" height="95" srcset="https://www.theblogstarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/social-media-for-bloggers.png 600w, https://www.theblogstarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/social-media-for-bloggers-300x48.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></noscript></p><p>While you don’t want to overdo it, you still want to create accounts with the “biggies” like Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Pinterest, and Instagram.&nbsp; You should post a link to your newest content on your accounts, but you can also post relevant news and links to other sources that your readers may find interesting.&nbsp; Don’t forget to use hashtags and engage with your followers!</p><p>One of my favorite ways to get visitors to my blog is to post links on my social accounts, like Facebook and Twitter. This is great, because not only do your friends see the link, but if your friends share the link with their friends it automatically multiplies your visitors. If you have created high-quality content on your blog then social media is a way for your blog to go viral.</p><h4>Comment on Other Blogs</h4><p>Find other blogs in your community and engage with them. Using the comment section, introduce yourself and leave engaging and constructive comments. Many will allow you to leave a link to your blog. After creating relationships with prominent bloggers in your community, you will find yourself within their ranks quickly.</p><h4>Engage with Your Visitors</h4><p>When your readers leave comments on your posts, always engage with them. Reply to their comments and questions, give them “likes” and affirmations. When it is obvious that the author cares about his/her community and readership, visitors are naturally encouraged to return.</p><h4>Collaborate with other bloggers</h4><p>Become enmeshed in your blogging community by collaborating with respected members of your field. Collaborating includes guest posting, promoting each other’s blogs and products, and regularly interacting through comments and social media.</p><h4>Post Regularly</h4><p>Post content regularly. Create an editorial calendar and stick to it. A good blogger posts at least once per week to start. If you have long lapses between posts, your followers will drop off and your growth will be severely hampered. It’s not easy to post on a schedule, but it’s something you absolutely must stick to.</p><h4>Create an Email List</h4><p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3978" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20600%2095'%3E%3C/svg%3E" alt="promote your blog using an email list" width="600" height="95" data-lazy-srcset="https://www.theblogstarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/email-list-for-bloggers.jpg 600w, https://www.theblogstarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/email-list-for-bloggers-300x48.jpg 300w" data-lazy-sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-lazy-src="https://www.theblogstarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/email-list-for-bloggers.jpg"><noscript><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3978" src="https://www.theblogstarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/email-list-for-bloggers.jpg" alt="promote your blog using an email list" width="600" height="95" srcset="https://www.theblogstarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/email-list-for-bloggers.jpg 600w, https://www.theblogstarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/email-list-for-bloggers-300x48.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></noscript></p><p>In addition to getting new visitors to your blog, you will also want to make sure your current visitors are coming back. This is where email marketing plays a big role. By collecting the email addresses of your visitors (with their permission of course), you can then notify them when you post new content on your blog.

It could take six months to a year to start seeing a steady stream of income. Blogging takes work and dedication, but once you develop a large enough audience, there are several methods you can employ to monetize your blog.</p><h4>Sell advertising space</h4><p>Once you have a popular blog, advertisers will be hounding you for the opportunity to advertise. The best way to take advantage of this situation is to use Google Adsense. Google finds the advertisers for you and all you have to do is place the Google Adsense code on your blog to start running ads. Google Adsense takes all of the hard work out of the process and just cuts you a check.</p><p>I go into the full details of <a href="https://www.theblogstarter.com/how-to-install-adsense-on-your-wordpress-blog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">how to set up Google Adsense for your WordPress blog here</a>.</p><h4>Sell affiliate products</h4><p>An affiliate program is a commission-based way to advertise. When one of your readers clicks on a link on your blog, they get sent to an advertiser’s site and you earn a commission if they purchase. Affiliate links are a nice way to earn income through the use of product reviews. However, you must remember to disclose that you are an affiliate for the product.</p><h4>Sell Products and Services</h4><p>Selling your own products and services directly on your blog is a great way to increase your income. As your blog grows and you begin to see a wide audience, your products and services will begin to sell themselves.</p><p>Use the sidebar of your blog to increase the visibility of what you sell using visual images and a link to your storefront page.</p><h4>Sell digital downloads</h4><p>Ebooks, video tutorials, and e-courses are the most commonly consumed digital materials sold by bloggers. With little to no overhead and no shipping costs, you can keep the price low and inviting.</p><p>If you are extremely knowledgeable in your field, an ebook can practically write itself. Give it a try, you might surprise yourself!</p><h4>Sell memberships</h4><p>Another way to monetize is by creating membership options on your blog. This allows you to offer members more exclusive content only available with a paid membership. For example, you could offer unlimited downloads of digital goods, free consultations, a private network or forum where community members can mix and mingle, and private content available to members only.</p><p>There are many ways a blog can capitalize on popularity and traffic. Choosing the way you monetize from your blog depends on your goals and the purpose of your blog. Those who are selling services, physical goods, and digital goods, for example, may not want to participate in affiliate programs where traffic could be lost to another site.</p><p>For more information see my <a href="https://www.theblogstarter.com/how-to-make-money-blogging/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">full guide to making money blogging here</a></p><h3>Need more help?</h3><p>I hope this guide has answered any questions you had on how to start your blog, but if any of the steps were unclear to you, you can <strong>find a more detailed version of each step</strong> by using the menu at the top right of this page (or at the bottom of this page if you’re on a smartphone).</p><p>More <a href="https://www.theblogstarter.com/blog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">specific tutorials can be found on my blog page</a>.

You. It is your passion, your creativity, your knowledge and expertise, and what you bring to the community that makes a blog successful. As long as you provide content that is interesting, informative, and engaging to the readers you’re looking to connect with, your success is only limited by the number of posts you’re able to produce.<p></p><p>Keep writing, keep interacting, keep engaging, and your blog quickly become one of the success stories. As long as you’re passionate about the subject matter, the sky is the limit.<br></p></div><h3 class="collapseomatic " id="id66dbd9b65df68" tabindex="0" title="What do you need to start a blog?">What do you need to start a blog?</h3><div id="target-id66dbd9b65df68" class="collapseomatic_content content" style="display: none;"><p>Time, passion, and a clear goal.</p><p>Blogging is nearly a full-time operation. A successful blogger commits to posting lengthy and detailed content at least weekly. Promoting the blog must also be done regularly across social accounts and through peer interactions.</p><p>Equally important is the passion behind your blog. To come up with great content on a regular basis your blog should revolve around a topic that you are obsessed with. You don’t have to be the leading authority on the subject matter. You only need to possess passion, excitement, dedication, and deeply rooted opinions.</p><p>You also need a clear goal in mind. What is the main objective of your blog? Is it to inform the public? To eventually retain paid subscribers? With a clear final objective you can grow a blog that satisfies these goals in the long term.<br></p></div><h3 class="collapseomatic " id="id66dbd9b65df98" tabindex="0" title="What should my blog be about?">What should my blog be about?</h3><div id="target-id66dbd9b65df98" class="collapseomatic_content content" style="display: none;"><p>Answer these questions: <em>What are you passionate about? What do you think about daily? What topic do you annoy all of your friends, family, and co-workers with on a regular basis? What do you find yourself dreaming about? What do you find yourself constantly researching? What do you read about?</em></p><p>If there is a common denominator in your answers to these questions – THAT is what your blog should be about.</p><p>Your blog should be about what interests you – what you’re passionate about. And once you begin to build your blog, no matter what the subject material, you will find a community of people who are interested in what you have to say.<br></p></div><h3 class="collapseomatic " id="id66dbd9b65dfbe" tabindex="0" title="How do I find a profitable niche for my blog?">How do I find a profitable niche for my blog?</h3><div id="target-id66dbd9b65dfbe" class="collapseomatic_content content" style="display: none;"><p>If you know the general topic for your blog, a simple way of making your niche more profitable is by narrowing the niche to eliminate competition.</p><p>For example, let’s say you’re passionate about food and you want to start by creating a recipe blog. You’ll be competing with a million recipe blogs. So let’s narrow that topic down to something that is more manageable yet still important to a lot of people.

You can begin blogging as soon as your account is set up.  You can easily customize your self-hosted WordPress blog just by following the steps in the tutorial on this page.<br></p></div><h3 class="collapseomatic " id="id66dbd9b65e03e" tabindex="0" title="How much does it cost to start a blog?">How much does it cost to start a blog?</h3><div id="target-id66dbd9b65e03e" class="collapseomatic_content content" style="display: none;"><p>You can make a blog for absolutely nothing. It doesn’t cost one red cent.</p><p>But let’s be realistic. If you want your blog to be taken seriously, you can’t just get a subdomain from one of the free blogging sites like Blogspot. You’ll want to pick a custom domain name and register it instead. Domain names cost around $15 per year, on average. So now you’re a whopping $15 in the hole.</p><p>But the best way to start your blog is through one of the many web hosting companies. The best web hosting choice is a WordPress hosting account through <a href="https://www.theblogstarter.com/go/bluehost/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bluehost</a> which is $2.75 per month and includes free domain name registration, so your total cost for 1 year is just $33.</p><p>These are your main costs associated with starting a successful blog. Of course, you may incur other costs with additional services such as email marketing. As with any business, the biggest expenditure is often advertising, but this would be a cost incurred later on down the road if you choose to go that route.<br></p></div><h3 class="collapseomatic " id="id66dbd9b65e05c" tabindex="0" title="Do bloggers make money?">Do bloggers make money?</h3><div id="target-id66dbd9b65e05c" class="collapseomatic_content content" style="display: none;"><p>Bloggers have the ability to make a full-time income from blogging alone. Some bloggers make hundreds of thousands of dollars. While it isn’t easy to become a highly paid blogger, it is quite possible. As with any business, it takes a lot of hard work and plenty of time.</p><p>Many bloggers give up on their project after just a few months. They become discouraged when the money doesn’t come in right away, and it almost never does without an instant and immediate following that comes from being a high profile persona. Therefore, time and patience are needed to reach “influencer” status. Those who make money online are the ones who stick with it.</p><p>There are several ways a blogger can earn money:</p><ul><li><strong><u>Advertisements</u>:</strong> As your blog gains traction and brings in a healthy amount of daily visitors, advertisers may pay good money for a well-placed ad on your blog.</li><li><strong><u>Contextual Ads:</u></strong> With Google Adsense a small piece of code can be placed on your blog that dynamically shows ads related to your content. When one of your readers clicks on an ad the advertiser pays Google, and Google sends you a percentage.</li><li><strong><u>Affiliate Programs:</u></strong> Affiliate ads are a very popular way to monetize a blog. These ads lead visitors to a product or service on another website. If a sale resulting from a click on your blog is made, you get a commission, and some commissions can be very high. Affiliate programs can be found on individual stores, or on large-scale platforms such as Amazon.</li><li><strong><u>Sponsored Posts:</u></strong> Advertisers can pay a smaller fee to sponsor individual posts rather than advertising on the entire blog. This is a great method for making money on fledgling blogs.</li></ul></div><h3 class="collapseomatic " id="id66dbd9b65e07c" tabindex="0" title="How do bloggers get paid?">How do bloggers get paid?</h3><div id="target-id66dbd9b65e07c" class="collapseomatic_content content" style="display: none;"><p>Bloggers are most commonly paid by advertisers. How the blogger is paid varies depending on what type of ads are used.</p><ul><li><strong><u>CPC:</u></strong> CPC or “Cost Per Click” ads generate revenue simply through clicks. CPC ads are generally highly targeted and rotational. Ads appear on specific blog posts and are related to the content of that post. The number of clicks you generate, which trends upward as your traffic increases, will ultimately determine the amount you are paid.</li><li><strong><u>Flat Fee:</u></strong> If a blog’s traffic is high, advertisers may pay a monthly flat fee for ad space on the blog’s website. That ad space could appear all over the website, within a section, or just a few pages. The money comes directly from the advertiser.</li><li><strong><u>Commission</u></strong><u>:</u> Ads from an affiliate network use affiliate links. These links track visitors that come from your blog to the advertiser’s site. If a purchase is made by a visitor who originated from your blog, you receive a commission.</li></ul></div><h3 class="collapseomatic " id="id66dbd9b65e09c" tabindex="0" title="Should I start my blog on WordPress?">Should I start my blog on WordPress?</h3><div id="target-id66dbd9b65e09c" class="collapseomatic_content content" style="display: none;"><p><strong>If you’re new to blogging and you don’t have much experience with HTML or coding, then yes – self-hosting a WordPress blog is the best choice for you! </strong>When it comes time to choose a blogging platform, the pros turn to WordPress.&nbsp; And even though WordPress is used by millions of smaller blogs, it also powers many of the biggest sites on the internet.&nbsp; In fact, WordPress is the most popular CMS (Content Management System) in the world with over 75 million blogs and websites currently using it. And there are many reasons why:</p><ul><li><strong><u>Easy to Use</u></strong><u>:</u> WordPress is remarkably easy to use. Theme customizers help to easily design your blog, change colors, and add images. Once your design is complete, all you need to do is write your content. The internal blog editor records your posts and displays them for you.</li><li><strong><u>Blog Anywhere</u></strong>: As long as you have Internet access, you can edit your WordPress blog and write new posts. WordPress provides you with an administrative backend where you may log in and work on your blog from anywhere in the world using a PC, Mac, tablet, or smartphone.</li><li><strong><u>You Don’t Need To Know How to Code</u></strong><u>:</u> WordPress gives you easy tools to set up a blog that looks stunning without knowing a single line of HTML code or hiring a web developer. This makes WordPress a great option for those who don’t want to deal with technical issues.</li><li><strong><u>Built-in SEO</u></strong>: Google favors blogs built with WordPress. The out-of-the-box SEO (Search Engine Optimization) which comes packed with WordPress delivers impressive results over time in search engines. This translates to more readers for your blog.</li><li><strong><u>Free Themes</u></strong>: The WordPress CMS is connected to a repository where thousands of free themes (blog layouts) are available to browse and upload. Directly from the backend of your blog you can browse a multitude of themes with varying styles and functionality. These free WordPress themes can be installed with one click, and then easily customized by a total beginner.</li></ul></div><h3 class="collapseomatic " id="id66dbd9b65e0bc" tabindex="0" title="Is WordPress free?">Is WordPress free?</h3><div id="target-id66dbd9b65e0bc" class="collapseomatic_content content" style="display: none;"><p>Yes! A self-hosted WordPress blog is a open-source, which is completely free. And there are two different WordPress options, both free, but <em>COMPLETELY</em> different, which you should be aware of.&nbsp; Choosing between them is one of the most crucial decisions you will make.</p><p><strong><u>WordPress.org</u></strong>: This option is completely, 100% free.&nbsp; WordPress.org is the blog platform I show you how to use in the tutorial on this page.&nbsp; While it is completely free to download, it doesn’t run on its own. You will need a web host (see the <a href="https://www.theblogstarter.com/#bloggingsteps">step-by-step guide</a>) and you’ll also need to buy a new domain name. Because you need your own web hosting plan, this option is known as a self-hosted WordPress blog. So while WordPress is technically free, there are fees involved with getting your new self-hosted WordPress blog up and running (less than $3 per month).</p><p><strong><u>WordPress.com</u></strong>: WordPress.com is a different platform that lets the user create a free blog on a subdomain of WordPress.com. While it does technically let you blog for free, if you would like to enable some basic options, or have your own domain, you will have to upgrade your account to a paid plan.&nbsp; For this and other reasons, I don’t recommend WordPress.com.<br></p></div><h3 class="collapseomatic " id="id66dbd9b65e0db" tabindex="0" title="How often should I blog?">How often should I blog?</h3><div id="target-id66dbd9b65e0db" class="collapseomatic_content content" style="display: none;"><p>If your goal is to eventually make money from your blog, you’ll want to start blogging as often as possible – at least once per week. Blogging can be casual if your goal is solely for personal pleasure. But if you’re seeking a large audience and wish to become a leader in your field, blogging weekly is a must.</p><p>While frequency is important, it should not come at the expense of quality.&nbsp; Not every piece of content needs be 2,000 words, but all of your posts should be informative and of value to your audience. This is no easy feat. However, if you’re able to stick with blogging on a regular schedule, it will become easier! As with anything else, the more you do it – the more skilled at it you become.</p><p>Blogging weekly also helps improve your traffic from search engines, which you can track in your Google Analytics account. When you first begin blogging your latest posts will take time to show up on search engines. As you continue to post regularly you will naturally have more blog posts showing up in the search results, which means more traffic to your blog.<br></p></div><h3 class="collapseomatic " id="id66dbd9b65e0f8" tabindex="0" title="Why do blogs fail?">Why do blogs fail?</h3><div id="target-id66dbd9b65e0f8" class="collapseomatic_content content" style="display: none;"><p>Almost any blog has the potential to become a success, yet most blogs fail. And there are many reasons why. Here are the most common reasons why a blog fails:</p><ul><li><strong><u>Giving Up Too Fast</u></strong> – The most common reason why a blog fails is simply that the content creator gives up before his or her blog even has a chance to become recognized. Before you begin a blog, you should realize that most blogs take months and even years to gain traction. It’s quite an investment. If you fail to gain visitors or make money within a month don’t stop!&nbsp; Continue to focus on creating quality content and getting your name out there via social media and networking.</li><li><strong><u>Intermittent Blogging</u></strong> – When there are long “silent periods” between posts it is difficult to build a solid following. People looking for information on your topic usually want a steady stream of new information to keep them interested. When a blog fails to deliver fresh and updated content people get bored and look elsewhere.</li><li><strong><u>Poor Content</u> </strong>– Some bloggers think they can beat the system with auto-generated content or with duplicate content that is reworded. Readers know fluff when they read it. They know when an article has absolutely no value or when it is simply clickbait. A blog with poor content will never be successful.</li><li><strong><u>Too Many Ads</u></strong> – Blogs with dozens of ads obscuring most of the content will deter visitors from returning. People don’t come to your blog to be visually harassed by ill-placed, blinking advertisements. They come for information. While ads a good option to monetize, don’t overdo it.</li></ul></div><p></p></div>
